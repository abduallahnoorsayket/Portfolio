##### Fobex: Enterprise-Grade Figma to UI Conversion

Role: Senior Frontend Developer Core
<br>
Stack: HTML5, Bootstrap 4+, SCSS, JavaScript (ES6), Swiper.js
<br>
Architectural Solutions & Project Highlights


<ul>
  <li> Modular Component Architecture: Implemented a reusable UI component strategy. By abstracting repetitive elements (Headers, Footers, Cards) into a consistent structure, I ensured code maintainability and reduced the final CSS footprint.</li>
  <li> Pixel-Perfect Figma Fidelity: Utilized advanced CSS techniques (Flexbox/Grid) to ensure 100% design accuracy across 10+ complex pages, including Service Details, Case Studies, and Pricing tables.</li>
  <li>
    Asset Optimization & Performance: Optimized heavy UI assets and integrated Swiper.js with lazy-loading configurations, resulting in high Core Web Vitals scores and smooth touch-interactions for mobile users.</li>
  <li>   Responsive Scalability: Developed a "Mobile-First" fluid grid system using Bootstrap’s utility classes, ensuring a seamless experience from 320px mobile screens to 4K ultra-wide monitors.</li>
  <li>
    SEO & Accessibility (WCAG): Structured the HTML using semantic tags (article,section, nav) to enhance screen reader compatibility and search engine indexing.</li>
</ul>
