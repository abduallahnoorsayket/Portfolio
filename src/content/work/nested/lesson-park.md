Lesson Park is a production-grade lesson aggregation platform for the Japanese market, enabling users to discover and compare sports, education, music, IT, and early-childhood lessons by category, prefecture, and location.

I designed a scalable, component-driven architecture focused on search performance, data normalization, and responsive UX. The platform supports high-volume listings, advanced filtering, and map-based discovery while maintaining accessibility-aware UI patterns and mobile-first design.

The system was structured to remain extensible beyond its no-code foundation, with clear separation between data models, workflows, and presentation—allowing future migration to custom backends or external APIs without architectural rework.
