A production-grade flight booking platform supporting B2B and B2C users, including agents, agencies, and administrators. The system covers the full booking lifecycle—from flight search and pricing to PNR creation, ticketing, invoicing, and post-booking management—across multiple regional configurations (Dhaka & Italy).

I worked on the frontend architecture and feature implementation using Vue.js 3, Pinia, and Tailwind CSS, focusing on scalability, reliability, and UX consistency. The application follows a modular, role-based architecture with reusable components, centralized state management, and API-driven workflows.

##### Key contributions include:

<ul>
<li>Designing and improving flight search architecture (best-price logic, calendar loaders, modal-based search, pagination). </li>
<li>Implementing and fixing PNR lifecycle flows (retrieve, cancel, ticket, service charge & AIT calculation). </li>
<li>Enhancing agent/office/user management with permission-based UI rendering. </li>
<li>Improving UX with structured modals, loaders, transitions, validation handling, and responsive layouts. </li>
<li>Introducing E2E testing foundations using Cypress and documenting testing strategy. </li>
<li>Managing multi-branch workflows, deployment coordination, and post-deployment regression testing. </li>
<li>The system was designed to handle high-volume transactional flows while remaining extensible for future pricing rules, discounts, and regional business logic. </li>
